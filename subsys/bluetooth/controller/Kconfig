config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_XTAL_ADVANCED
	bool "Advanced event preparation"
	default y
	help
	  Enables advanced event preparation offset ahead of radio tx/rx, taking
	  into account predictive processing time requirements in preparation to
	  the event, like control procedure handling and CPU execution speeds.
	  Crystal oscillator is retained between closely spaced consecutive
	  radio events to reduce the overall number of crystal settling current
	  consumptions.

	  This feature maximizes radio utilization in an average role event
	  timeslice when they are closely spaced by using a reduced offset
	  between preparation and radio event.

	  By disabling this feature, the controller will use a constant offset
	  between the preparation and radio event. The controller will toggle
	  crystal oscillator between two closely spaced radio events leading to
	  higher average current due to increased number of crystal settling
	  current consumptions.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_XTAL_THRESHOLD
	prompt "Crystal shutdown threshold in uS"
	depends on BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_XTAL_ADVANCED
	int
	default 5168
	help
	  Configure the optimal delta in micro seconds between two consecutive
	  radio events below which (active clock) crystal will be retained. This
	  value is board dependent. The value 5168 is based on crude calculation
	  for nRF51 current versus startup time of high frequency crystal.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_SCHED_ADVANCED
	bool "Advanced scheduling"
	depends on (BLUETOOTH_MAX_CONN != 0)
	default y
	default n if BLUETOOTH_PERIPHERAL && !BLUETOOTH_CENTRAL
	help
	  Enable non-overlapping placement of observer, initiator and master
	  roles in timespace. Uses window offset in connection updates and uses
	  connection parameter request in slave role to negotiate
	  non-overlapping placement with active master roles to avoid slave
	  roles drifting into active master roles in the local controller.

	  This feature maximizes the average data transmission amongst active
	  concurrent master and slave connections while other observer,
	  initiator, master or slave roles are active in the local controller.

	  Disabling this feature will lead to overlapping role in timespace
	  leading to skipped events amongst active roles.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_FAST_ENC
	bool "Fast Encryption Setup"
	help
	  Enable connection encryption setup in 3 connection intervals.
	  Peripheral will respond to Encryption Request with Encryption Response
	  in the same connection interval, and also, will respond with Start
	  Encryption Response PDU in the 3rd connection interval, hence
	  completing encryption setup in 3 connection intervals. Encrypted data
	  would be transmitted as fast as in 3rd connection interval from the
	  connection establishment.
	  Maximum CPU time in Radio ISR will increase if this feature is
	  selected.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_CONN_RSSI
	bool "Connection RSSI"
	help
	  Enable connection RSSI measurement.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_ADV_INDICATION

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_ASSERT_HANDLER
	bool "Bluetooth Controller Assertion Handler"
	depends on BLUETOOTH_HCI_RAW
	help
	  This option enables an application-defined sink for the
	  controller assertion mechanism. This must be defined in
	  application code as void \"bt_controller_assert_handle(char \*, int)\"
	  and will be invoked whenever the controller code encounters
	  an unrecoverable error.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_PROFILE_ISR
	bool "Profile radio ISR"
	help
	  Turn on measurement of radio ISR latency, CPU usage and generation of
	  controller event with these profiling data. The controller event
	  contains current, minimum and maximum ISR entry latencies; and
	  current, minimum and maximum ISR CPU use in micro-seconds.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_DEBUG_PINS
	bool "Bluetooth Controller Debug Pins"
	help
	  Turn on debug GPIO toggling for the BLE Controller. This is useful
	  when debugging with a logic analyzer or profiling certain sections of
	  the code. When enabled, pins P0.16 to P0.25 are taken over exclusively
	  by the controller and cannot be used outside of it.
