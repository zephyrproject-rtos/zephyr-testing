 *
 * This routine allows a thread to wait concurrently for one or many of
 * multiple poll events to have occurred. Such events can be a kernel object
 * being available, like a semaphore, or a poll signal event.
 *
 * When an event notifies that a kernel object is available, the kernel object
 * is not "given" to the thread calling k_poll(): it merely signals the fact
 * that the object was available when the k_poll() call was in effect. Also,
 * all threads trying to acquire an object the regular way, i.e. by pending on
 * the object, have precedence over the thread polling on the object. This
 * means that the polling thread will never get the poll event on an object
 * until the object becomes available and its pend queue is empty. For this
 * reason, the k_poll() call is more effective when the objects being polled
 * only have one thread, the polling thread, trying to acquire them.
 *
 * Only one thread can be polling for a particular object at a given time. If
 * another thread tries to poll on it, the k_poll() call returns -EADDRINUSE
 * and returns as soon as it has finished handling the other events. This means
 * that k_poll() can return -EADDRINUSE and have the state value of some events
 * be non-K_POLL_STATE_NOT_READY. When this condition occurs, the @a timeout
 * parameter is ignored.
 *
 * When k_poll() returns 0 or -EADDRINUSE, the caller should loop on all the
 * events that were passed to k_poll() and check the state field for the values
 * that were expected and take the associated actions.
 *
 * Before being reused for another call to k_poll(), the user has to reset the
 * state field to K_POLL_STATE_NOT_READY.
 *
 * @param events An array of pointers to events to be polled for.
 * @param num_events The number of events in the array.
 * @param timeout Waiting period for an event to be ready (in milliseconds),
 *                or one of the special values K_NO_WAIT and K_FOREVER.
