/**
 * @brief Statically define and initialize a Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS).
 *
 * A CBS is an extension of the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduler
 * that allows tasks to be executed virtually isolated from each other,
 * in a way that if a task executes for longer than expected it doesnâ€™t
 * interfere on the execution of the others. In other words, the CBS
 * prevents that a task misbehavior causes other tasks to miss their
 * own deadlines.
 *
 * In a nutshell, the CBS is a work-conserving wrapper for the tasks
 * that automatically recalculates their deadlines when they exceed their
 * allowed execution time slice. This time slice is known as the CBS "budget".
 * The value used to recalculate the deadline is known as the CBS "period".
 *
 * When a task instance (i.e. job) runs within a CBS, it consumes the "budget".
 * When the "budget" runs out, the deadline is postponed by "period" time units
 * and the "budget" is replenished to its maximum capacity. when there are no jobs
 * left for a CBS to execute, it remains idle and takes no CPU time.
 *
 * Finally, whenever a new job is pushed to an idle server, the kernel verifies
 * if the current pair of (budget, deadline) are proportionally compatible with
 * the configured values. If not, the deadline is also recalculated here.
 * These two procedures ensure the CBS will never use the CPU more than
 * what was configured, and that it will not endanger other thread's deadlines.
 *
 * Once created, the CBS can be referenced through its name:
 *
 * @code extern const struct k_cbs <cbs_name>; @endcode
 *
 * @param cbs_name Name of the CBS.
 * @param cbs_budget Budget of the CBS thread, in system ticks.
 * Used for triggering deadline recalculations.
 * @param cbs_period Period of the CBS thread. in system ticks.
 * Used for recalculating the absolute deadline.
 * @param cbs_static_priority Static priority of the CBS thread.
 *
 * @note The CBS is meant to be used alongside the EDF policy, which in Zephyr
 * is effectively used as a "tie-breaker" when two threads of equal static priorities
 * are ready for execution. Therefore it is recommended that all user threads feature
 * the same preemptive static priority (e.g. 5) in order to ensure the scheduling
 * to work as expected, and that this same value is passed as @a cbs_static_priority.
 *
 * @note you should have @kconfig{CONFIG_CBS} enabled in your project to use the CBS.
